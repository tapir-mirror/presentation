**Mira: Your Personal Growth Mirror** ðŸªž

Mira analyzes your online presence to reveal how others perceive you, then provides personalized coaching to bridge the gap between who you are and who you want to become.

**What it does:**
- Scans your LinkedIn/social media to generate a personality analysis
- Visualizes your "vibe" with an interactive personality radar chart  
- Provides AI coaching conversations tailored to YOUR specific traits
- Offers anonymous feedback collection from friends (no awkwardness!)
- Creates a personalized growth roadmap with daily accountability

**Why it's different:**
Unlike generic self-help apps, Mira uses a novel 3-model architecture: a therapist AI for guidance, your personal data archive for context, and a custom AI trained on you + your chosen mentors. It's like having a coach who truly knows you.

**The vision:**
Everyone deserves authentic growth support. Mira makes self-awareness accessible, manipulation-resistant, and actionable. We're building a future where your ideal self isn't just a dreamâ€”it's a personalized AI companion helping you get there.

*Built for people who want real change, not generic advice.*
