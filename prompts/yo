Prompts:

Can we create something in the spirit of Tiny Shakespeare based on all interviews or public material available on a person? Like talk like Churchill or Kim Kardashian or a hybrid between the two? 

Can we build the Tiny Shakespeare with a ratio for various historical, fictional, and contemporary figures like a mosaic? For example 20% Queen Rania, 15% Boris Johnson,  10% Elon Musk 5% Shallon Lester 5%Evy Pompouras 5%Mbappe, 10%Napoleon, %Gordon Bennett %10 the Dowager of Downton Abbey, 10%Sherlock Holmes, and the rest Cicero?

What if we want to fine tune it from a certain perspective like: Queen Rania’s eloquence, Boris’ ability to avoid questions with humour, Shallon’s humour, Evy’s straightforwardness, Cicero’s empowerment, etc? 

If we were to construct an ideal self digital twin based on a proportion of historical, fictional, and contemporary figures we admire, what’s the optimal and healthy proportion from a psychological point of view between these references and our own best features? 

Does the Wikipedia api also include wiki quote? Also for movie characters and book characters what resources do you recommend?

Does this work if the user puts : Cicero: empowerment, Napoleon: ego, or Mandela, Gandhi: Wisdom? 

Can you add a search key in the YouTube-transcript-api Python module? 

What if I want some Shallon Lester videos and can’t search for them via the YouTube api (budget wise)? 

If I want an app in which the user adds someone like Shallon and expects something without providing the video id? 

Can you write me a code to access quotes from a book character or a historical figure via Project Gutenberg? 

Do we have to download the books? Isn’t it more resource efficient to extract the quotes from somewhere?  

So wikiquote would give me something like Rebecca Sharpe?

So for creating a digital twin out of my ideal self, I need to build a multi head CNN with 60% weight of a corpus provided by my texts, 15% of historical references, 15% of contemporary, and 10% of fictional. How do you recommend I embed what quotes and transcript and other text data I obtain? LSTM? What values should I put in the nn.Layer? 

If I want them more substantial, what parameter do I change?
