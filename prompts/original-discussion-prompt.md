Okay, so we are doing a hackathon. Team's name is Mira. Um, And we were really interested in personality authenticity representation how we come across. Yeah. And so to speak. We're we're interested in Vibe. Yeah. And the vibe cutting hackathon. We're talking about Vibes. Yeah. And how do you come across?

That was one of the things that started us thinking about how you can look at someone's representation. Firstly online. Yes. Yeah. So maybe look through, uh, social media. A profile that they have. This could be LinkedIn, this could be tiktok. This could be Reddit and then pull pull all of that information down and run an analysis on.

How they are coming across in terms of what type of personality are they projecting? What kind of a? Um, how would someone external perceive them? Um, And based on that, we talked about how you might be able to help this person signpost courses, they might want to do or books.

They might want to read, or think, or people. They might want to speak to, in order to be To be to evolve. Positioning how they are seen Pops even suggest how they could re rewrite some of what they've got. Yeah, I think there's a there's a mentorship element so it can give you access to resources and point you in the right direction.

I think that's one thing people will find appealing. I think we also talked a little bit about like the idea of resilience to you know, if the machine can find all these things about you then. So can other people and that can potentially be used to manipulate you. So ultimately, we're trying to empower people to see what can be found about them.

And if they know that, then they're presumably better able to, you know, resist people trying to manipulate them

Uh, we can integrate various resources both digital as well as the real life on Um, people can follow in order to fulfil their potential. We can also introduce some time management and discipline accountability tools. Like, daily checks, or whatever. Did you work on your accent? Did you work on your mirror?

Presentation, did you work on having a book or a Napa on on your head to improve your posture? Anything like this? I think that's yeah. I think that's often what people want from tools and people are you know what's been provided is something that's going to tell you all your ideas are absolutely great and it's gonna wait very patiently for you to, you know, tell it what to do.

When actually you want something that is maybe a little bit more, you know, critically. Inspiring. And, you know, Yeah, I'm and the accountability aspect of I like that. Both. In terms of, The these are, these are your commitments, these and, and maybe a daily check-in around that I guess the The other part was, The other thing we talked about is is is getting Anonymous feedback from close friends about how you come across.

So, if the mirror is, is giving you a suggestion of this is what the perception of you is but you might out of hand dismiss it perhaps that the the the system could allow your people who know you or your friends to be able to weigh in on whether Not or or how it is that you are coming across without putting them on the spot in so far as if it says, well you come across as a overbearing.

Numb at all. Uh, and you don't really think that if you ask a friend maybe to your face, they will say, oh no I think you're very kind and all of that. But actually if it was truly Anonymous, they could say, well, you know, actually 60% of the time you come across as you know, you have no interest in anyone else's opinion.

I mean I the, the people are so polite and they might want to tell you, you need to, I don't know. Break up with that person. That is treating you badly. They're not going to tell you that directly but that might be something where the agent, the model can basically go.

And, you know, We'd have to get right. But like I think it can act as an interface so that it can not just get a better sense of who you are from other people, but also potentially be a vessel for, like, you mentioned the idea of a bridge which I thought was really nice and it can sort of Bridge.

Um, Bridge, but maybe a bridge between you and other people. Yeah. So you're talking about, uh, we were talking about bridging Bridges as a theme and allowing people to, you know, move from, they might want to give advice, but they don't know how to do it. Other times, you know, well, there's a big body of advice that people can draw upon but it's difficult to parse it.

And there are, you know, there are loads of resources online that can give you see, people giving advice, and if you go through it enough, you can get some good advice. But a lot of people are nervous to even post or um you know, uh so and then we talked about different personality types that you sometimes you don't want a conversation partner or coach that has the same as you.

You maybe want somebody very different sometimes you want somebody who is the same. Because but that is something that you kind of, you don't know immediately and it's something that you need to almost experiment with. Yeah. So, just Around the kind of this some sorry, maybe a little bit of a summary around the concept of a mirror.

Uh, in a way so that you can reflect on it yourself so that it can give you guidance as what to do. From different perspectives. So that perhaps it can also give you insights and, and provide you with some personalised accountability. So the advice is not generic, despite the advice is very bespoke to you, actions that you can take tasks that you can do and then hold you accountable to do that.

I think what would be good is because we we it is a hackathon. Of course, we can't do everything. Yeah. But to divide into the different parts and if um, you as the large language model can help us divide Into kind of the different aspects of it, create the outline, functionalities, and be a little bit more imaginative, perhaps that we.

And then we have been in this chat. As to what are the different things put that in a in a comprehensive document so that we can then reflect on it? Um, I have this idea. Um, so basically, uh, If you want you can stop or not, if you Thinking of the digital twin your ideal self, but your ideal self.

Uh you you have a prism of people. Oh, you've been running up Boris and the Elon Musk right? Or whatever? Yeah. So uh you have the data collection on how you're perceived and you have your ideal self like based on Tiny Shakespeare. How and you just suppose this and the root the uh Of the framework on what you should.

You should enhance and what you should work from the distance. From this juxtaposition between the ideal self and the and the current data on you. Current data, which blends your public person on LinkedIn and all the data corrected from your your friends. And I was thinking you, you can have a feature through which the accountability life coaches is actually your ideal self and is your ideal set.

You say, I'm like this blah blah. I'm kind of like quinranian, Boris and whatever. Uh, I'm your ideal self in, whatever like a realistic time frame. Like let's say in five years or two years. Uh, And you conduct yourself with your the kindness, the level of kindness or Spartan military whatever and uh, okay.

Have you done your speeching? Uh, yeah. Execution lessons. Yeah. But, um, between your teeth stuff or whatever? Did you work with your Apple on your head and stuff like that? And it's your digital twin by. It's your ideal self. Actually, that does this. And you, you can integrate our feature through, which you can, uh, update that ideal self.

Because, for example, you may, as, as you, you progress, you you change this, uh,

Do therapy or whatever. You might change this. And you can, let's is it possible to have a model that updates on your progress? So there's really interesting questions. So effectively, what you can do is you can fine-tune a model with new data and sometimes it's, you know, automatic reinforcement.

So just give it a bunch of new data and it learns from it. Sometimes it's manual. Like it will give you two options and you say which one is more authentic. So we you can do that. The problem with that is and this is why I'm never that worried about giving that much data to, I don't know.

They can train. They can use your data but it's not computationally or practically efficient for them to do that. So um, Learn in real time, is that we're still a few, I think a few years at least away from that. But what you can do is you can basically take text and turn it into a, some kind of database and then use that database, to support the model answers.

I think it's called like retrieval augmented generation, so it can use a synopsis of the, the - And that's also I was thinking about that in relation to what you said about. Um, You know, training on these character people that are, you know, maybe we want it to be like this sort of persona. I think we what we could, we could take some really common, uh, like people that people might aspire to, but I worry a little bit that that then is like, we're limiting people to certain, you know, famous figures.

And what we can maybe do instead is build in a capacity for let's say, you say, you are really interested in I don't know who's the guy that I was, uh, Walter Pitts who's one of the inventors of and there's not that much data on him, but you can get what what is available and then pull it in and the model isn't necessarily trained on it but it has it as a reference that it can refer to does that kind of make sense.

Yeah so we bought in terms of the fine tuning. I still think it would be if we can to get a model and to fine-tune it a little bit maybe on books about life coaching and about therapy and just collecting a bunch of material about that and all of this is already in the models like it's already been trained on the entire internet but say we want to reinforce this type of coaching style Behaviours but again I don't know how practical it'd be.

Did I show you this?

Instead of using a static database, you're using another model. The other thing is, I wonder if we would need to have some kind of a scientific framework when they just made me think about like because you know mentoring coaching, there are different tools, there are different techniques. There are different scientific kind of, you know, psychological Frameworks in order to do the analysis.

So you know, whether it's the ocean model, you know, openness Consciousness, extroversion agreements, and your artistism or if it's some other type of attachment Theory or some other, there are plenty of Theories and models that Frameworks that exist around your personality. And and I guess maybe that would be some other way to help you.

Frame it. So it's not just saying, So that you can have some kind of a repeated measure, like you said you wanted to be more Comfort. And these kinds of situations and how how could you show that over a period of time that has occurred rather than just obviously maybe you could just self-report but to your point of let you know updating that model it doesn't necessarily need to be a black box model of you.

It could be set against a an established way of measuring and it could even be something that you you know, a questionnaire that you fill in or I don't know. Something that is a conversation that would give you a situation and say how would you behave? So that, you know, you can't necessarily game in and say, I'm always safe, I'm always good all of that, you know, that that kind of thing so that you can show You the progress that you've made?

As a way of encouraging you maybe as a way of reinforcing the the direction of travel, it's very hard to change your personality if at all possible. Right. It's really hard to change. Your instincts about how you feel about situations without a lot of reinforcement. Um, So I'm not 100 sure we'll be able to build all of this.

No, no, no. I think it's really good because I think actually because I'm now heading in direction of. Oh, this is actually really something that is novel. That I don't think people have done before or at least not in Practical sense. But like so, but just this is me thinking about, and again, we don't need to necessarily do this.

We should do something simpler to build it like a Concept and then build it out. But so you have your primary model this is a, it's Locally host like a trained model that kind of works similar to TPT or Gemini or something like that, but it's fine-tuned to be more of a therapist, okay?

On the one hand and then also work with two things. One is a personal archive of the conversations you've had with the model already and the stuff you've told it maybe if you're collecting data from social media it's it's done that and that's put it in your personal archive alongside the personal archive.

You have a personal model that is a very low spec model because if we it's not but it basically it it is your personal model that is learning from the experiences and the conversations or habit and then this big main model, doesn't it? It parses the conversation from your personal model just to stop your just to stop your personal model being too crazy.

Basically because low spec models they I don't know if you they can sometimes be absolutely just random and not get the point. And does that kind of make sense?

What sounds quite technical. I think I mean again I think it's something that vibe coding if we have clear requirements of what we want. Do you think we could wipe code a small model that's based on like you or me or like a gp2? Which is what you just showed.

I think we could do that. Yeah. And I think you can even like automate some of the elements of the training so that it knows when you have enough material to train it and does that kind of make sense, kind of? Yeah but you can also build something that is less less complex and think about the interface you want to have.

And then at the beginning maybe we don't have all of that functionality built out. Maybe it's just talking to a another. Yeah and giving you the interface and collecting the data, right? So

And I think that's the thing that would be, you know, because you can just use Tech GPT or Gemini or something like that for the solution. Yeah. So it's like what is the novel thing that we're bringing? Okay. But I think actually building something that is this more personalised cash of your Your private previous conversations but now actually chat CPT and perplexity start doing anyway.

But also the idea of a personal model that is trained on you. Specifically not on just on you but on your mentors and the people you look up to and things like that. And so it it isn't just back to your ideal self. So the gpt2 again, we'll see how gpt2 is a little bit.

Like I I remember using it and it was just completely like you were it was like a dream, you know, when you're going from one room to another and it doesn't make sense that you would get from this room, which is in one place to a room in a completely different country in a different time.

That's what using gpt2 is like. So it's limited. But if you think about what we're trying to do, which is a various psychological app. Yeah, that actually can potentially not be a bad thing because it it is prompting you to. I really love the personalised aspect of it. If you have your that's actually when you started talking I was thinking about, you know, some of these big the big names in the

Better help, you know, like, but yeah, just just be more mindful on all those things. They're not personalised. They're just a set of things that, you know, everybody was running through. It's not like, hey, Alex is gonna be about X Y and said, actually, this is how he finds gum.

This is how what, you know, or was actually, okay, we've got a lot of ideas, we've got it, but this is good and we're getting the recording and we'll be able to go through down the other thing, I mean, I was going to mention about Marius Briggs in a ways and people like, oh it's too wish, what wish he was.

I think, I don't think it's wishy-wossy enough because if you look at this psychology and computer science, and it was on personalities and I definitely went down and like Mars brings us about a bullshit but I okay not bullshit, it's just context. It is, it's purely. Contextual. Yeah, so there's nothing wrong with that.

No. But I'm just thinking about it based on young Yin archetypes and sort of even know more about it a lot. I've got a lot of time. I study kabala. So we need to incorporate some of this wacky stuff. Well yeah, so like not can you bring in young into it?

That'd be quite cool. I mean, I think

It cut the tape.
