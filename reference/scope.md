‚Äî-
Minimum Viable Demo (What judges will see):
Opening: Connect LinkedIn ‚Üí Instant personality analysis with beautiful visualization
Middle: Have a coaching conversation that references the analysis
Climax: Show how the system is "learning" about the user (can be simulated)
Close: Vision slide showing the three-model architecture
What to Actually Build:
Beautiful UI with the three-model concept clearly shown
Basic LLM integration (use OpenAI API - or Anthropic / OpenRouter with custom prompts)
One working data source (Linkedin)
Compelling visualizations (personality radar, growth trajectory)
What to Fake/Simulate:
Personal model responses (pre-write some "dream-like" insights)
Model training progress (just show a progress bar)
Complex psychological framework scoring
üí° Killer Feature Ideas:
"Vibe Check": Real-time analysis of how a post/message will be perceived
"Shadow Work Mode": Using the low-spec model's randomness for breakthrough insights
"Mentor Mashup": Combine 3 different influences into your personal model

Remember: The judges won't know what's real vs. simulated. Focus on telling a compelling story about personalized growth that goes beyond generic apps. The technical complexity can come later!

Would you like me to create any additional resources like UI mockups descriptions, sample conversation flows, or a technical implementation checklist?
